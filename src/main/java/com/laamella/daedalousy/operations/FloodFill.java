 * A quick and dirty yet useful utility can be implemented with a single call to
 * a graphics library's Fill or FloodFill routine. FloodFill the passage at the
 * beginning, and if the end isn't filled, the Maze has no solution. For Mazes
 * with an entrance and exit on the edges, FloodFill one wall, and the remaining
 * edge marks out the solution. For Mazes with the start or goal inside the
 * Maze, FloodFill the surrounding wall, and if the exit wall isn't erased, wall
 * following won't work to solve it. Many Maze creation methods, solving
 * methods, and other utilities involve "flooding" the Maze at certain points.
